We currently live in a world that is highly consumer of digital content and in this sense there is a need on the part of companies to adapt digital marketing techniques. Inbound marketing, unlike traditional marketing in which companies reach the public, is a set of techniques and approaches that make the public reach companies freely. Nowadays nobody wants to be interrupted by advertisements and anyone looking for solutions online has to be convinced very quickly. In other words, it is necessary to provide content that has value for the target audience.

During this internship, a tool was developed that allows companies to create campaigns, following inbound marketing strategies.
